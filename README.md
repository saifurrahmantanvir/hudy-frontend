# Getting started with `hudy.` app

Hi, everyone. This is my full-stack ecommerce app. I used `React JS` for frontend and `Node JS` for backend.\
You can checkout the shop without login. Start shopping by creating an account(API features signup). You can pay with stripe for buying products.

### Here is what I used to build the frontend

1. React.js (React Hooks, React Router V6)
2. React Redux
3. Redux Toolkit
4. Stripe Payment Gateway
5. Axios
6. Framer-motion
7. Sass

### Here is what I used to build the backend

1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB (Mongoose)
4. Rest Architecture
5. Bcrypt.js
6. JWT Authentication
7. Multer
8. Stripe Payment Gateway
9. Pug
